### Question 1. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain what the following lines of code do

It is telling fizzbuzz to be fs.readFileSync and to fallow the path of './src/js/fizz-buzz.js'. thats basically all i can say at this point 

### Question 3. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain the difference between using === and == in JS?

=== means we are looking for if both sides are the same
== is testing for loose equality. Double equals also performs type coercion
